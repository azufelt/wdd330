          <h2>Questions:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Why did the exercise use 'getElementByID' and not 'querySelector'?
            </li>
            <li>
              What are the most common reasons to use localStorage() in the real
              world?
            </li>
            <li>
              In the assignment it says to "record your findings" but, I'm a
              little unsure what I'm supposed to record.... "Yes, I did see my
              story saved to local storage, and now I can recall it and edit
              it"?
            </li>

          <h2>Notes:</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>
              When you want to show something to a user, use a section, and
              innerHTML. If you have user input make sure to use value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Key-value pairs allow the user to look up and retrieve from local
              storage the item that they saved.
            </li>
            <li>
              Speed Matters--1.8% of Users on 4g, opposed to 25% of users on 3g
              (2013 stat)! ·Reduce image size, use SVG/webfont to lower
              bandwidth. ·Optimize and minify files. ·Gzip foles to eliminate
              unnecessary data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reachability, make it easy for users to get to the controls. Move
              central nav to the bottom inside thumb-zone for single handed
              users. Created a perception of speed/faster. Which caused further
              user satisfaction
            </li>
            <li>
              Hamburger: Menu with border had the highest conversion rates. Menu
              alone got 22% LESS clicks, it wasn't clear that the nav did
              anything. Menu alone with border got 20% MORE clicks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mobile Forms-> Make it simple, so user can USE it, easily. Reduce
              Cognitive Load. Use FLoat label, so user doesn't forget what
              they're filling out! Only ask for information that user needs. If
              a longer form is needed, paginate the form. Enable auto-complete
              on form, increases conversion rates. Passwords: masking isn't
              completely necessary. Credit Card, auto-advance!!! I love that!!!
              Give user the best keyboard for input that is being asked for...
              phonenumber-- pull up the number pad. Phone numbers- don't list
              numbers as text only, link them as a phone number, for
              tap-to-dial.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertising-> mobile ads NEED to be re-tooled for mobile devices.
              Pop-ups, etc. Ugh, I hate all of those mobile ads. If you need to
              have an ad, make it less than 40% of your realestate. could do
              video ads=> have higher convesion rates. A cut-out ad that is a
              window behind what the uiser is doing. STOP USING POP-UPS!!! Give
              them content, and use advertising sparingly. Content FIRST.

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Learning to code the JavaScript for the Story Editor was a really
          great way to see how you can set/get/edit/save an item to local
          storage.
          <br />
          <br />
          The overview of how big of a role Mobile plays in our current digital
          world was great. A bit of an overview, but a very nice reminder of
          just how absolutely important it is to design for the smallest
          screens, and go up from there to maximize the suer experience while
          keeping development maintenance to a minimum.
